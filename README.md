Rating must be between 1 and 5

Data Integrity:

All foreign keys enforce referential integrity
Unique constraints on user emails
Non-null constraints on essential fields
Cascade delete rules for dependent records


Indexing Strategy
To optimize query performance:

Primary keys (user_id, property_id, booking_id, etc.) are automatically indexed
Foreign keys are indexed for faster joins
Email field in User table is indexed for authentication queries
Property location field is indexed for search functionality
Booking dates are indexed for availability checks
Composite index on (property_id, check_in_date, check_out_date) for booking conflicts


Technology Considerations

Database: PostgreSQL (supports UUID, JSON fields, and complex queries)
ORM: Django ORM for database interactions
Migrations: Django migrations for version control of schema changes
Backup Strategy: Regular automated backups with point-in-time recovery
Scalability: Database connection pooling and read replicas for high traffic


This database design provides a solid foundation for the AirBnB Clone project and can be extended with additional features such as messaging, wishlists, and property amenities as the project evolves.
